    "Let us get started with Python and pip.\n",
    "* Python is a programming language. We can install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org).\n",
    "* Python contain certain functionality in the form of functions out of the box. However, over a period of time the open source community of Python have come up with libraries for the common and reusable functionality.\n",
    "* Those libraries can be installed using `pip`. It is nothing but Python's package manager.\n",
    "* You can install, upgrade, uninstall, list the details of installed libraries using `pip`.\n",
    "* Here is one of the common practice we follow with respect to starting a new application using Python as programming language.\n",
    "  * Make sure right version of Python is installed for your project/application.\n",
    "  * Create virtual environment for your project.\n",
    "  * Activate and install required libraries.\n",
    "  * Develop the required functionality.\n",
    "  * We can deactivate the virtual environment or activate other virtual environment if we have to switch over to another Python application.\n",
