    "Let us understand how to setup Spark locally on Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here are the pre-requisites to setup Spark Locally on mac.\n",
    "  * At least 8 GB RAM is highly desired.\n",
    "  * Make sure JDK 1.8 is setup\n",
    "  * Make sure to have Python 3. If you do not have it, you can install it using **homebrew**.\n",
    "* Here are the steps to setup Pyspark and validate.\n",
    "  * Create Python Virtual Environment - `python3 -m venv spark-venv`.\n",
    "  * Activate the virtual environment - `source spark-venv/bin/activate`.\n",
    "  * Run `pip install pyspark==2.4.6` to install Spark 2.4.6.\n",
    "  * Run `pyspark` to launch Spark CLI using Python as programming language.\n",
    "* Here are some of the limitations related to running Spark locally.\n",
    "  * You will be able to run Spark using local mode by default. But you will not be able to get the feel of Big Data.\n",
    "  * Actual production implementations will be on multinode cluters, which run using YARN or Spark Stand Alone or Mesos.\n",
    "  * You can understand the development process but you will not be able to explore best practices to build effective large scale data engineering solutions."
